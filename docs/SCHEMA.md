# The data model — THE single source of truth

**Authoritative as of 2026-08-08 (migration 0133). If any other document, comment, or
plan contradicts this file, this file wins and the other one is wrong.**

Read this before touching places, visits, trips, stats, or containment.

## Why this file exists

The same schema work was redone at least five times. The cause was not carelessness —
it was that **three different models were each "authoritative" in some document**, so
every session picked one and undid the last:

| Document | Claimed a trip is… |
|---|---|
| `docs/adr/0001-place-visit-entry-trip-model.md` | a first-class `trips` row, **not** a place |
| `NewClaude.md` (private originals) | a **place** that is a non-counting rollup |
| What Erica actually wants | a **visit she marked** |

Worse, two mechanisms silently *regenerated* the retired model, so data fixes could
not hold:

1. `sync_place_category` had `when NEW.categories @> array['trip'] then 'trip'` as its
   second branch. Migration 0127 cleared that category; every later UPDATE re-derived
   it. Cape Cod ended up back at `category='trip'` → `counts_as_place=false`, holding
   10 photos and a real visit while counting as **nothing**.
2. `visits.is_trip` was a GENERATED column, `end_date > start_date` (migration 0047),
   so the database promoted **any** multi-day visit to a trip by arithmetic. 50 of 485
   visits were flagged trips that Erica never marked. Brewster's 2-day stay was one.

Both concepts are now removed, not merely cleaned up. There is nothing to regenerate.

## The model — two nouns

### PLACE — counts **once**, ever

A row in `places`. Every real thing is one: a city, a region, a restaurant, a beach, a
trail, a destination like Cape Cod. Returning to a place does **not** add another
place; it adds a visit.

```
counts_as_place = NOT is_trail
```

A **trail** is the only thing that does not count, because it is a rollup of segments
that already counted — counting it too would double-count. A destination **always**
counts. There is **no `trip` place category**; do not add one back.

A city is both a place you visited *and* a box holding other places. It is not one or
the other. San Diego counts, and so do the taco shop, the beach, and the ride.

### VISIT — counts **every** time

A row in `visits`: dates, attribution, and evidence. Two stays in San Diego are two
visits at one place.

- `is_trip` — **a person marked this visit as a trip.** Nothing automatic ever sets
  it. Not duration, not a stop count, not an importer. `set_visit_is_trip()` is the
  only way, and it requires owner/editor.
- `status` — `taken` (it happened) or `planned` (a future-dated trip).
- `manual` — protects the row from `rebuild_place_visits`, which deletes derived
  visits. Any marked trip is `manual = true` for exactly this reason.
- `solo_profile` — attribution. `null` = **Both**; otherwise that person. Attribution
  lives on the visit only, never on the place.

**Photos and activities are evidence hanging off a visit.** They are not sibling rows
and never their own visits. Brewster is one 2-day visit that contains a ride and a
run — not three visits.

## Containment

A place attaches to a container two ways:

- **spatially** — coordinates inside a `boundary` polygon (cities, regions)
- **by explicit link** — `place_membership`, for trails and destinations

`place_membership` is canonical. `places.part_of` is the legacy array that the
membership trigger mirrors; write through `part_of`, read from `place_membership`.

## The statistics

Every stat uses the same view rule, so they can never disagree:

```
p_profile IS NULL  ->  visits where solo_profile IS NULL          ("Both")
otherwise          ->  that person's visits PLUS the Both visits
```

| Stat | Definition |
|---|---|
| Places | distinct places with a qualifying visit, where `counts_as_place` |
| Visits | count of visit rows (the map badge = number of visits, never days) |
| Trips | count of qualifying visits where `is_trip` and `status='taken'` |
| Miles | sum of `activities.distance`, attributed the same way |

## Naming (migrations 0129–0131)

There is **no automatic naming.** The nightly geocoder and the dupe-merger were
unscheduled in 0130 — they were the thing overwriting names within the hour.

- `name_locked` — a person named it; automation must never rewrite it
- `named_by` — who chose the name
- `name_scope` — the space it was named in: a profile id = that person's own space and
  only they may rename; `null` = the shared Both space and either may

A real name is claimed on **any** write by a trigger (0131), so the several client
creation paths cannot drift out of sync one at a time.

## Rules for changing this

1. Never reintroduce a `trip` place category or a derived `is_trip`.
2. A one-shot data fix that a trigger can undo is not a fix. Remove the mechanism.
3. Every rule here is enforced by a DB test in `supabase/tests/`. If you change a
   rule, change its test in the same migration — and give the test a negative control
   that fails when the rule is removed.
4. Update **this** file, not a new plan document.

## Retired — do not restore

- The `trips` / `trip_stops` tables (a trip is a visit).
- `places.category = 'trip'`, and `holds_children` including `'trip'`.
- `visits.is_trip` as a generated column.
- Auto-detected / `suggested` trips that reappeared as new suggestions daily.
- The nightly geocode and dupe-merge schedules.
